## Node packages

* [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript): it will install `tsc` that you will need this to compile *.ts files
* Server-side execution
    * [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node): allows you to execute TS files on the fly
* Client-side execution
     * [parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel): web application bundler that will help us run TS in the browser

## Run plain TypeScript

### Run TS in the server with ts-node on the fly

> **Note**: this setup is mainly for development enviroments

If you want to start practicing just with TypeScript we recommend you to do it directly in node.

You can compile and execute typescript like this:  

```bash
$ tsc index.ts
$ node index.js
```

But after installing `ts-node` you will be able to execute TS in the terminal like this:

```bash
$ ts-node index.ts
```

### Compile, watch and run TS 

We will normally use the TS compiler (`tsc`) to compile *.ts files. Like with `npm` we can create a config file with: `tsc --init`.

We can set where the source and compiled files will be, and many more things (check all [tsc CLI options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)).

Using `tsc -w` we ask TypeScript to watch any changes in the source folder and recompile any time it finds a change.

Now we will use two additional packages:

* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detecte
* [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently): Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.

So run: `npm install nodemon concurrently` and in the package.json add:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "start:build": "tsc -w",
        "start:run": "nodemon build/index.js",
        "start": "concurrently npm:start:*"
    }
}
```

Run `npm run start`.


### Run TS in the client with Parcel

> **Note**: this explanation is just for dev environment

Create an index.html file:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
    <body>
        <script src="index.ts"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Create an index.ts file in the same folder:

```typescript
// index.ts
console.log("Hello world");
```

Run: `parcel index.html`

## Type definitions

When using a third party library like AngularJS, jQuery, Lodash, ... in TypeScript we need to have files specifying the types, interfaces and classes it library defines to be able to properly check and parse the code. 

Doing that the VS Code will also be able to show visual aid while coding through code autocompletion as [explained here](../README#ide-setup-to-speed-up-your-development).

These files can be found on npm like `@types/{library_name}` for example: [@types/angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/angular), [@types/jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jquery), 
[@types/lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/lodash), 
[@types/openlayers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/openlayers) and of course **[@types/arcgis-js-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/arcgis-js-api)** (check [DefinitelyTyped repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types) to see more).

To use them will have to install just that package like this: `npm install @types/arcgis-js-api`.

This files can also be used from VS Code. After installing the package using command and click on a class it will open the type definition.

## Run 3rd party JS libraries with TypeScript

### Run ArcGIS API using AMD + CDN with TS

This is the case of this demo app. Please check the [source README.md](../README.md) to better understand how to run to do it.

### Run ArcGIS API using ESM + Angular (TS)

[Check this folder](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples/jsapi-angular-cli).
